# WebXR Guides

## Project Overview

WebXR Guides is a browser-based WebXR application that delivers step-by-step 3D work instructions for Meta Quest headsets. It provides an open-standard alternative to Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides, leveraging WebXR and open web technologies to guide users through complex procedural tasks using interactive 3D models.

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- Meta Quest Browser runtime
- WebXR (immersive-vr mode)
- Single GLB 3D model per guide
- 5–7 procedural steps per guide
- Hand-based gesture navigation (Next / Back)
- Visual highlighting of model parts
- Floating XR UI panels for instructions and controls

### Out of Scope
- World-scale spatial anchors
- Offline support / caching
- Multi-user collaboration
- Voice commands
- Enterprise integrations (CRM, analytics, etc.)
- Mobile AR support

## Done Definition

This Phase 0 is complete when:
- ✓ Folder structure is established and documented
- ✓ README clearly defines scope and constraints
- ✓ demo-guide.json schema is defined
- ✓ No implementation code written (planning phase only)

Phase 1 begins when all Phase 0 items are signed off.

## Supported Devices
- Meta Quest 3 / 3S (via Meta Quest Browser)
- Meta Quest Pro (via Meta Quest Browser)
- Any WebXR-capable headset with immersive-vr support

## Known Limitations
- Phase 0 is structure and documentation only
- No runtime implementation yet
- No authoring tool yet
- No WebXR or IWSDK integration yet
