/**
 * Marks an entity as eligible for XR/UI pointer interaction.
 *
 * @remarks
 * - The {@link InputSystem} discovers all entities with `Interactable` and, when
 *   XR visibility is Visible, registers their Object3D roots as raycast targets
 *   (computing BVHs for meshes to accelerate intersection tests).
 * - When a pointer enters/leaves or presses/releases on the entity, the system
 *   adds/removes the transient tags {@link Hovered} and {@link Pressed} so other
 *   systems can react declaratively without manual event wiring.
 * - Add this tag to the root Object3D of your UI/interactive object. Children
 *   are implicitly covered because the InputSystem registers the whole subtree.
 *
 * @category Input
 * @example Highlight on hover
 * ```ts
 * export class HighlightSystem extends createSystem({ items: { required: [Interactable] } }) {
 *   update() {
 *     this.queries.items.entities.forEach(e => {
 *       e.object3D.visible = !e.hasComponent(Pressed);
 *       e.object3D.material.emissiveIntensity = e.hasComponent(Hovered) ? 1.0 : 0.0;
 *     });
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
