 * Component for physics bodies. A physics body is a virtual object that represents a physical

 *
 * @remarks
 * - Static bodies are used for immovable objects like walls and floors.
 * - Dynamic bodies respond to forces, collisions, and gravity.
 * - Kinematic bodies can be moved programmatically but don't respond to physics forces.
 * - Internal properties like `_engineBody` are managed automatically by {@link PhysicsSystem}.
 *
 * @example Add a dynamic physics body to an entity
 * ```ts
 * entity.addComponent(PhysicsBody, {
 *   state: PhysicsState.Dynamic
 * })
 * ```
